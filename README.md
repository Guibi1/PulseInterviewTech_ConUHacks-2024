# PulseInterview.tech: Revolutionizing Interview Preparation

## Inspiration ðŸ˜‹

PulseInterview draws inspiration from the pressing need to reshape the interview preparation landscape. In a world saturated with platforms focusing on analytical questions or chatbot interactions, our project is a response to the critical role of effective communication and presentation skills in interviews.

## What it does ðŸ¤“

In today's competitive job market, securing an interview is a significant challenge. PulseInterview is designed to ensure candidates excel in this crucial step by providing a comprehensive interview preparation experience. Our AI-powered software conducts mock interviews, offering detailed analysis and feedback on various aspects, including attire, visual presentation, and speech patterns. The platform uses GPT to generate tailored interview questions based on user CVs and job descriptions, simulating realistic interview scenarios.

To replicate the actual interview environment, users are prompted to film their responses. Feedback encompasses attire analysis and overall visual presentation. Video responses are securely stored in a Google Cloud Service bucket, with one random frame selected for dress analysis. The system also converts videos to MP3 for audio analysis, utilizing speech-to-text technology for transcription. GPT evaluates responses, providing commentary and scores based on positives and negatives criteria. Audio analysis involves segmenting the audio into 5-second clips to identify speech speed variations and offer personalized insight on delivery.

User feedback, including areas of improvement, is presented through a JSON sent to the front end. The nature of questions varies based on job roles, covering technical queries for software engineering positions and ethical questions for HR roles. PulseInterview also includes an ethical component for technical roles to assess candidates' well-roundedness. Additionally, the platform features a comprehensive CV analysis tool, benchmarking user CVs and generating professional CVs. MoviePy and the speech_recognition library from openai are employed for video and audio processing.
